<p style="font-size:20; text-align:center; color:blue ; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom:40px;">A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">What are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
<p style="font-size:20;">Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens. They are a type of digital currency that allows people to make payments directly to each other through an online system. Cryptocurrencies have no legislated or intrinsic value; they are simply worth what people are willing to pay for them in the market. This is in contrast to national currencies, which get part of their value from being legislated as legal tender. There are a number of cryptocurrencies â€“ the most well-known of these are Bitcoin and Ether.<br>

Activity in cryptocurrency markets has increased significantly. The fascination with these currencies appears to have been more speculative (buying cryptocurrencies to make a profit) than related to their use as a new and unique system for making payments. Related to this, there has also been a high degree of volatility in the prices of many cryptocurrencies.<br> For example, the price of Bitcoin increased from about US$30,000 in mid 2021 to almost US$70,000 toward the end of 2021 before falling to around US$35,000 in early 2022. Rival cryptocurrencies like Ether have experienced similar volatility. The extraordinary interest in cryptocurrencies has also seen a growing amount of computing power used to solve the complex codes that many of these systems use to help protect them from being corrupted. Despite the increased level of interest in cryptocurrencies, there is scepticism about whether they could ever replace more traditional payment methods or national currencies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">How Does a Cryptocurrency Transaction Work?</h2>
<p style="font-size:20;">Cryptocurrency transactions occur through electronic messages that are sent to the entire network with instructions about the transaction. The instructions include information such as the electronic addresses of the parties involved, the quantity of currency to be traded, and a time stamp.<br>

Suppose "You" wants to transfer one unit of cryptocurrency to "Your friend"."You" starts the transaction by sending an electronic message with her instructions to the network, where all users can see the message."Your" transaction is one of a number of transactions that have recently been sent. Since the system is not instantaneous, the transaction sits with a group of other recent transactions waiting to be compiled into a block (which is just a group of the most recent transactions). The information from the block is turned into a cryptographic code and miners compete to solve the code to add the new block of transactions to the blockchain.<br>

Once a miner successfully solves the code, other users of the network check the solution and reach an agreement that it is valid. The new block of transactions is added to the end of the blockchain, and "Your" transaction is confirmed. (This confirmation is not instant as it takes time for six blocks of transactions to be processed so that users can be certain that their transaction has been successful.)</p>
<ol>
<li>"You" sends instructions to transfer cryptocurrency to "Your friend". Anyone using the network can view the message.
<li>Miners group the transaction together into a 'block' with other recently sent transactions.
<li>Information from the new block is transformed into a cryptographic code.
<li>Miners compete to find the code that will add the new block to the blockchain.
<li>Once the code is solved, the block is added to the blockchain and the transaction is confirmed.
<li>"Your friend" receives the cryptocurrency.
</ol>
